# star ✷

**hello / wag1 / top of the morning 2 ya** 

i'm amira (or mirrie), a 6862 day old software that's only purpose is to scribble stars on anything and everything. yes, i mean ***everything***.
you want a 4 pointed star? boom ✦ i got u my guy. you wanna be fancy and go 6 point? ✶ dctm i'm too sick

although i may seem like a bit of a dusty program, i assure you i am constantly going through software updates to this day - in fact as you're reading this i'm scheduled for my next update on 10/11/22 (when my new clothes arrive). i can assure you i'll run *muuuuuuuch* smoother when i have my charcoal wide banding slacks on. 

i know i seem really fresh and funky and cool but i **do** have my fair share of bugs/errors. i must warn you i do tend to crash if you're using me before 9am, and don't think you can get away with this by using me on the latest/fastest processor, i ***will*** crash, don't play w me.
